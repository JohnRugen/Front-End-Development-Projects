Overview of current projects included:
 
ToDo List: 
This is a simple web app that allows users to add, remove and check off tasks. It was completed using HTML, CSS, Javascript & Jquery.

Personal Portfolio: 
This is my portfolio website created with HTML, CSS, Javascript & Bootstrap. It'll change and adapt within time.

Tortuosity:
This is a web based quiz app for geology students. It was created within my final year at university. Whilst it makes use of a database to allow students within a lecture
to connect, I'm placing it in the front end repo. This is because I used Firebase to handle the database. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this application at university.
More information and documentation can be found within the project.
